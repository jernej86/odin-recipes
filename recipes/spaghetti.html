<p>TThis classic Roman pasta dish is quick and easy to make with few ingredients. T
    raditionally, guanciale is used, but I prefer pancetta.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided, or more if needed</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>27 ounces pancetta bacon, diced</li>
        <li>2 cups passata (crushed tomatoes)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water, or more as needed</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
        Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, 
        until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet 
        over medium heat and cook onion until golden brown, about 
        5 minutes. Add pancetta and cook, stirring occasionally, 
        until crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in passata, water, and 
        sugar; 
        cook until sauce has thickened, 10 to 15 minutes</li>
    <li>Drain spaghetti and toss with sauce, remaining olive oil, 
        Parmesan cheese, and red pepper flakes. 
        Season with salt and pepper.</li>    
</ol>
