<p>This is a rich, dark chocolate topping or decoration that 
    has lots of uses. It can be whipped as filling or icing, 
    or just poured over whatever cake you like.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>9 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dark rum (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Place the chocolate into a medium bowl. 
        Heat the cream in a small sauce pan over medium heat. 
        Bring just to a boil, watching very carefully because 
        if it boils for a few seconds, it will boil out of the pot. 
        When the cream has come to a boil, pour over the chopped 
        chocolate, and whisk until smooth. Stir in the rum if desired.

    </li>
    <li>Season chicken breasts. 
        Coat chicken on all sides with <strong>mayonnaise</strong>, and roll in 
        <strong>bread crumbs</strong> until coated. Place coated breasts into the 
        prepared pan.</li>
    <li>BAllow the ganache to cool slightly before pouring over a cake. 
        Start at the center of the cake and work outward. For a fluffy 
        frosting or chocolate filling, allow it to cool until thick, 
        then whip with a whisk until light and fluffy.</li>    
</ol>
